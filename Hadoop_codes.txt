codes
To get the list of files we use ls 
hadoop fs - ls
To create a directory in hadoop mkdir is used
hadoop fs -mkdir Data
To copy the file from local system to HDFS we use this code
hadoop fs - copyFromLocal ' /home/cloudera/Desktop/emp.csv'  Data
To get into the pig enviroment     
 pig
To get the present Working directory 
pwd
To change the Working directory 
cd Data
TO load the data with Schema
A= load 'emp.csv' using PigStorage(',') as (eid: int, ename: chararray, epos: chararray, esal:int, ecom: int, edpno:int);
To run and display
dump A;
TO load the data without Schema 
A2 = load '/user/root/pig/emp.csv’;
To get the structure of the file
describe A2;
To get the rows with edpno =to 20
B = filter A by edpno==20;
To get the rows with edpno =to 20 and in position of MANAGER
B2 = filter A by edpno==20 and epos=='MANAGER’,
To get only 3 rows
C = limit B 3;
To get the data in descending order
D = order C by esal desc;
To Store Data
store D into '/pig/pigout1’ using PigStorage(',’);
Select existing column
E = foreach A generate eid;
Create new column
F = foreach A generate *, ecom*2 as Bonus,esal*5 as Incentive;
Transform columns
G = foreach A generate SUBSTRING(ename,0,4);
Advanced codes
H = foreach A generate $0,$1;
I = group A by edpno;
J = foreach I generate group as edpno, COUNT($1) as count;
K = foreach A generate MAX(A.esal) as maxsal,MIN(A.esal) as minsal, SUM(A.esal) as sumsal, COUNT($1) as count;
L = group A by (edpno, epos)
SPLIT A into B if edpno==10, C if edpno==20, D if epos=='MANAGER';
Joins
A = load '/emp.csv' using PigStorage(',') as (eid:int,ename:chararray,epos:chararray,esal:int,ecom:int,edpno:int);
B = load '/dept.csv' using PigStorage(',') as (edpno:int,epos:chararray,ecity:chararray);
C = JOIN A by edpno,B by edpno;
D = foreach C generate A::eid,B::epos;
E = JOIN A by edpno RIGHT OUTER, B by edpno;
Word Count
lines = load '/plaintext.txt' as (line:chararray);
token = foreach lines generate TOKENIZE(line);
flats = foreach token generate FLATTEN($0);
group_words = group flats by $0;
count_word = foreach group_words generate group as word, COUNT($1) as word_occurence;



hive
to view the all the databases
show databases;
to creat a database
create database if not exists A;
to manipulate the database we should get into it ,for it we'll should use this query
Use A;
Check location from hdfs
hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse
Managed tables
create table if not exists emp(empno int, ename string, sal float, comm float, dpno int) row format delimited fields terminated by ',’;
To get the structure of the tables
describe emp;
To load the data from a file into the table
load data local inpath '/home/cloudera/Desktop/emp.csv' into table emp;
To view all the content in the table
Select * from emp;
To add External Tables
create external table  ext_emp1(empno int, ename string, sal float, comm float, dpno int) row format delimited fields terminated by ',’ location '/user/cloudera/data/emp’;
While giving path we have to give only directory path not file name
Here, table will be in given hdfs path.

create external table  ext_emp2(empno int, ename string, sal float, comm float, dpno int) row format delimited fields terminated by ‘,’;
Table will be stored under /user/hive/warehouse/A.db/ext_emp2/emp

load data local inpath '/home/cloudera/Desktop/empdata' into table ext_emp2;
set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode;
set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;

create external table emp_dept (empno int, ename string, sal float, comm float) partitioned by (dpno int) row format delimited fields terminated by ',’;
insert into table emp_dept partition(dpno) select * from emp;

Check
hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/A.db
create table dept_buckk(empno int, ename string, sal float, comm float, dpno int)  clustered by (dpno) into 3 buckets row format delimited fields terminated by ‘,’;
set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;
